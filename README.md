# üìùWrite It

## Inspiration
Our inspiration stemmed from the fact that we are all students with papers to write. The only "good" tool out there for spelling and grammar is Grammarly, and it's expensive as a tool, especially for students. We decided to build out a tool that's free and open-source, allowing not only students but everyone to focus on their work instead of having to pay for a tool they will only use 10 times a year.
Plus it is open source, so no need to worry about your passwords/card details being saved!

## What it does
Write.It will detect any spelling errors and give suggestions based on the input. Grammar corrections are also built-in to Write.It. After pressing the "Polish!" button, Write.It will automatically correct the piece of text and return its results back to the user.

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
We faced a lot of challenges and problems throughout the process of developing our website. We were originally planning to build a Chrome extension that can work on all sites but however, we learned that not all websites handle user inputs the same way. Hence we built a webpage that can correct your text.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we have successfully built the backend in less than 36 hours. We were skeptical that we would not be able to complete it within the hackathon duration but we did manage to get a working product ready!

## What we learned
We learned that building browser extensions are no easy task. It takes a lot of hard work and testing. Features that work on one site may break on another site. Although we did drop the idea of building an extension due to time constraints, we definitely plan to pursue it in the future!

## What's next for WriteIt: Writing Assistant
We plan to finish the browser extension of Write.it and launch it in various browser stores. We also plan to add context awareness and grammar correction to make predictions more accurate. Our plans also include building a deep learning model which will learn user inputs over time and adapt to them.
